Hello Mariana,

Thanks for answering my request, and sorry for the hour I’m responding to.

Sure, it’s okay if the interview is in English. It would be great if I get at least 2 weeks to start with the position to finish the current sprint and leave all in order.
I don’t need any work authorization; I’m Mexican, and I’m open to being relocated if needed. That sounds great.
My current annual compensation is divided into:

MXN 45,000 monthly gross salary.
Four months as an annual bonus. A gross total of MXN 180,000.
A month's gross salary as a Christmas bonus of MXN 45,000.
Vacation premium and days as the law says, MXN 11,250 gross.
I don’t get company stocks, saving funds, PTU, grocery, or gas coupons, or any other type of compensation.
Giving a total of MXN 776,250 as annual compensation.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
